ImportC now recognizes .h files just like .c or .i files

This means you no longer need to create a .c file with `#include` to import C headers from D code, you can now import them directly.

import stdio;

void main()
{
    printf("Hello world\n");
}

For example on a Linux setup with stdio.h in /usr/include:

$(CONSOLE
dmd -I/usr/include -run ../test/test_.d
Hello world
)
